# Dungeon Crawler

This is my first project in Pico 8 and using lua. It's a little rough around the edges but I did all the sprite work and coding without external help, so I still think it's amateurishly endearing!

Unfinished, but I implemented: movements, animations, (poor) collision physics, object interactions.
